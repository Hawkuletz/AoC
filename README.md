# AoC
Advent of Code Repository
Most of 2021 is in bash

C versions requires some of my libraries that I'm not ready (read: I'm ashamed) to make public. In my defense, those are more than a decade old :)
Will try to solve day4 of 2021 in bash as well, and maybe at some later time will make everything public.
